# Write a program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.
# Author Catherine Leddy





sent = str(input("Please enter a sentence and I will output ever second letter for you in reverse order!"))
sent2 = (sent[::-1])
print (sent2[::2])
print ('Hope you like your new sentence!')

# first task was to  create a string asking the user to input a sentence. This was defined as sent.
# The sent was then coded to  read backwards with sent2 = (sent[::-1])
# second task was to pick every second letter in the reversed sentence with print (sent2[::2])
